Welcome to the Application (APP) called Express Emotion: Sensory and Emotional Check-In for young children ages 3-8. 
It is best to proactively teach children when they are calm and curious about how this application can assist them in identifying, expressing and communicating their physical/sensory and emotional states. 
Attempting to introduce it when they are triggered, agitated or dysregulated will not be successful.

Exploring, discussing and explaining the application’s sensory images and feeling faces is an important first step in helping the child practice how to identify and communicate the physical sensations that are tied to their emotional states. 
This application is intended to be used with an adult and child together, NOT the child alone. 

# In other words, the APP is not intended to be used by a child without a caring, supportive adult to assist them in accessing and expressing the feelings and emotions they are experiencing, The objective is for children to be able to identify and express nonverbally or with their own words what they are sensing and/or feeling. The adult is supporting the child by first teaching body awareness and helping them tune inwards to their sensations and emotions. After the child has gained these skills, the adult can help the child effectively communicate when they are triggered emotionally, and outside their zone of optimal regulation.
This APP is not intended to provide treatment for children. 
If there is an emergency or ongoing persistent challenge, referrals for therapy or other evidence-based treatments is recommended.

Note: A child can practice by taking a photo with the APP of their own face showing an emotion or use a designated face for each zone (red, orange, blue or green).

# HOW TO USE THIS APP:

1. Before emotional literacy comes sensory awareness. Building Sensory and Body Awareness
is essential to children developing insight around what is happening in their body when they are in optimal states of regulation, hypo-aroused (frozen) or hyper-aroused (fight or flight). 
We all experience feelings (i.e. happy, sad, angry, lonely, frustrated), but we also experience sensations within our body (i.e. flowers, twisted up, shaky, jumpy, empty, frozen, tight, butterflies in my stomach).
Sensations and feelings are clues, and we can teach a child to be aware of both inorder to understand if they are in a triggered state, and if so, how to bring their mind and body back to the optimal state of arousal/regulation.

3. Whenachildistriggeredemotionallyandtheybecomedysregulated,theymaynotbeableto express themselves with words. Another way to help children express themselves without words is to point to objects that represent what they feel or the sensations they experience inside their body.


4. The best way to teach is when a child is calm. That way their executive or thinking brain can really be engaged in the lesson. When dysregulated it is difficult to access your thinking brain because of the intense emotions. 
So, teaching and practicing with a child when they are calm on how to use the APP to identify sensations and feelings, what each visual object means and how it might be tied to an emotion or sensation, is recommended.


5. Walk the child through the thermometer. Point out when they are in each part of the thermometer (red, orange, blue and green) there are feeling faces at the top of the screen that they can drag to the face of the silhouette body image and there are images representing sensations they can drag to where they may be feeling them in their body. 
They can communicate non-verbally or verbally to express to the adult what is happening in their body.
Another way to practice is to read stories to the child. Ask the child to use the APP to visually express what the characters in the book are feeling and guess as to the sensations that might be occurring in their body. Then you can begin to explore with the child about if they have ever experienced those same sensations and emotions. Practice makes for Progress!

or FREEZE.
b. Red–Representsastatesuchasanger,anxietyorfrustration,fear,scared,hurt(hyper-
arousal). This is when a child is in the “FIGHT” part of their survival brain when emotionally triggered. 
They can often be hurting others, themselves or property in this fight zone.c. Orange – Represents a state such as scared, frightened, terrified (hyper-arousal). This is when the brain is in a survival mode of FLIGHT or a need to run or escape from a situation. They can often be running away, hiding or trying to escape a situation.
d. Blue–Representsastatesuchasnumb,empty,disconnected,worried,unresponsive, frozen (hypo-arousal). The is when the brain is in a survival mode of FREEZE and the child is unable to think, respond or even move. They can feel nothing, be stuck, hiding or maybe even immobile.

Taking photos of their own face is recommended only during practice time, not when the child is triggered unless the child chooses to do that on their own. An adult should never snap a photo of a dysregulated child and show them “this is what you look like”.


8. Allowingachildtobeheard,expressthemselvesbothnonverballyandverballycanhelpthem establish a sense of calm and regulate their intense emotions. An adult that tunes in to a child's sensory and emotional state will support them in becoming calm again. Once calm, they can begin to access potential solutions, perspective taking, and thinking through problem solving steps.
This entire process will help them learn and understand the unique inner workings of their own sensations and emotions.

Children can be supported by nurturing and responsive adult caregivers over time to identify and express how they feel by dragging a feeling face to the silhouetted body. They can also be taught to help express what state they are in by using the thermometer to move across the color zones - green (calm), orange (flight), blue (freeze) or red (fight). Finally, they can use the visual images to the right of the body on the screen, which can represent any physiological sensations they may be experiencing inside their body.
Helping a child identify their sensations and feelings so that they may be heard and express themselves verbally or nonverbally will help them calm and regulate their intense emotions. There are four steps children need to learn in order to develop optimal brain and body regulation. You can teach these four steps using the APP:
(1) Identify sensations and emotions in their body,
(2) Identify how small, medium or large those sensations and emotions are,
(3) If their emotions are medium or large, identify several self-regulation or calming strategies to quiet
their brain and body so that they can do the fourth step,
(4) Think, think, think through a solution to solve their problem!
