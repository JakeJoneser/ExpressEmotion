# ExpressEmotion

When children cannot express their emotions through words, they can express emotions through this application.

The "Express Emotion" app supports emotion recognition, pointing or dragging sensory and sensory images onto the body, enabling children to communicate emotionally with adults without text.


Explanation of emotions expressed by images:


Fight images: be hurting others, yelling, screaming, hurting self, destroying property, argues, throws tantrums.


Flight image: child hides, runs away, falls asleep in the middle of an activity, watches from a distance, covers face or ears, absorbed in their own thoughts.


Freeze image: child is unresponsive, spaced out, not able to verbalize with words, withdrawn, repetitive behaviors or daydreaming.


If a child chooses Fight, Flight, Freeze because of trauma, it means that they are remembering the terrible past.

This time needs the care and support of adults to make them feel safe. 

Using this app can help children understand their state of mind, Inner emotions.
